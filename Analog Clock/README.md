# JavaScript Analog Clock

## Hey everyone 👋 Glad you came here! 😀

This is a clock that runs on purely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It takes an SVG as the basic HTML and CSS layout, then uses CSS animations to rotate the hands on the clock. The JavaScript provides the logic to move the hands according to the number of hours, minutes, and seconds there are in the time of the browser. The GIF used in the background can be found [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/1Ag2YZk48J9mAJXa0k/giphy.gif).
### So, this is our clock, which shows time, of course. 😉😎👍
